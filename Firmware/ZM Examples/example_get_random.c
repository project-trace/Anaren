 * @brief Resets Radio, gets a random number using SYS_RANDOM command and displays it.
 *
 * Configures the microcontroller to communicate with the radio, resets the radio, and sends the
 * SYS_RANDOM command and parses the received response and displays it to the console unless there
 * was an error. Demonstrates basic request-response functionality of the module.
